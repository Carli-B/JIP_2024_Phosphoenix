# JIP_2024_Phosphoenix
This folder contains the Unity project developed for Phosphoenix during the TU Delft Joint Interdisciplinary Project 2024. The repository can be downloaded and opened as a Unity project and contains relevant instructions for setting up the computer correctly. 

# Computer requirements
This project works best on Windows machines, as MacOS requires more intricate rights management and developer licenses when you try to build the projet as an application. Depending on the algorithm used for generating the stimulation patterns, a good GPU might be necessary.
The following applications should be installed on your computers
- Unity (duh)
- Varjo Base
- Optional: Visual Studio (Code) for edition C# scripts more easily. This works very well together with Unity.
Also, a conda environment with the correct Python packages is needed to run the image processing and stimulation pattern generation code. To set the conda environment up correctly, please refer to the manual in the main directory (setting_up_python.pdf). This manual also tells you how to set up the configuration file that the scripts in this project use.
